# Requirements Compliance & Traceability Matrix

This document maps every requirement from the course **Project Details** and the
**Grading Criteria** to its current status in this repository. It is both a
checklist for the team and a navigation guide for tutors/examiners.

It is deliberately **honest about what is not built yet** — a doc that claims
features the code does not have is worse than no doc (the rubric penalises
documentation that is "inconsistent with implementation").

**Status legend:** ✅ Done · 🟡 Partial / skeleton · ⬜ Not started

**Snapshot — last updated 2026-07-05**

| Area | Status | One-line summary |
|---|---|---|
| Mono-repo & workflow | ✅ | Mono-repo, feature-branch + PR + review, branch protection runbook |
| Client (React) | ✅ | React + Vite + TS + Tailwind, served behind reverse proxy |
| Server (3 Spring Boot microservices) | ✅ | user-progress, catalog, chat (Q&A orchestration); `chat` calls GenAI; Traefik gateway |
| Database (PostgreSQL) | ✅ | Postgres 16 via Docker, schema for users/progress/series/episodes |
| GenAI (Python) | ✅ | FastAPI `/genai/ask`; LLM call via LangChain `ChatOpenAI` (cloud/local base_url); spoiler-safe |
| OpenAPI / Swagger | ✅ | Single-source `api/openapi.yaml`, Swagger UI per service |
| Local run (docker-compose) | ✅ | `docker compose up`, ≤3 commands, sane defaults |
| CI | ✅ | Build + test + lint + e2e per service on every PR |
| CD (cloud) | ✅ | Rancher (Helm, auto-on-merge, `deploy.yml`) + Azure VM (Terraform+Ansible+Compose, `cd-azure.yml`) |
| Kubernetes (Helm/manifests) | ✅ | Helm chart in `infra/k8s/` (Rancher) incl. ServiceMonitor/PrometheusRule; Azure uses Terraform VM + Compose (documented trade-off) |
| Observability (Prometheus/Grafana/alerts) | ✅ | Prometheus + 2 Grafana dashboards + 2 alert rules; k8s ServiceMonitor/PrometheusRule/dashboard ConfigMap |
| Testing | ✅ | Unit + integration per service (incl. GenAI chain + spoiler-trap); Playwright e2e in CI |
| Engineering artefacts (UML, architecture) | ✅ | 3 UML diagrams + architecture doc |
| Documentation (README, responsibilities) | ✅ | README covers setup, CI/CD, testing, monitoring, responsibilities; `docs/responsibilities.md` RACI |

> **Biggest risks right now** (baseline features are now built — GenAI Q&A, CD,
> and Kubernetes are all implemented): (1) keeping a **stable tutor-accessible
> URL live** that reflects the final submission; (2) a **local `catalog` Flyway
> boot failure** observed on stale DB volumes (verify a clean boot / `down -v`);
> and (3) **alert notification routing** is not wired (alert *rules* exist, but
> no Alertmanager delivery). The remaining hard-fail exposure is the
> deployed-URL availability, not missing functionality.

## 10. Deliverables checklist

| Deliverable | Status | Location |
|---|---|---|
| Source: client | ✅ | `web-client/` |
| Source: server (3 services) | ✅ | `services/user-progress`, `catalog`, `chat` (Q&A orchestration) |
| Source: GenAI | ✅ | `services/genai/` (`/genai/ask` + LLM chain) |
| Dockerfiles + docker-compose | ✅ | `web-client/`, `services/`, `infra/docker-compose.yml` |
| Kubernetes (Helm/YAML) + instructions | ✅ | `infra/k8s/` (Helm chart + README, Rancher); Azure VM IaC in `infra/terraform/` + `infra/ansible/` |
| Monitoring config + exported dashboards + alert rules | ✅ | `infra/observability/` (Prometheus config, `tso-overview.json`, `traefik-dashboard.json`, `alerts.yml`) |
| Testing suite + run instructions | 🟡 | unit + integration + e2e present; consolidate run instructions |
| Documentation (README + responsibilities) | ✅ | `README.md` + `docs/responsibilities.md` |

## 11. Hard-fail criteria — must all be avoided

| Fail condition | Current standing | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Contributions not transparently documented (Artemis + GitHub) | ✅ | GitHub history + PR reviews + `docs/responsibilities.md`; keep Artemis activity visible |
| A member cannot explain their own subsystem | n/a (process) | Maintain clear ownership; oral exam prep |
| No working end-to-end system demonstrated | ⚠️ at risk (URL) | Core Q&A path is wired end to end; risk is now **keeping a stable deployed URL live** + a clean `catalog` boot |

## 12. Bonus opportunities (rubric)

| Bonus | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Advanced DevOps (autoscaling, self-healing, deploy strategies) | 🟡 | Self-healing via liveness/readiness probes + IaC (Terraform/Ansible) + Azure OIDC; autoscaling/HPA not yet added |
| Advanced observability (tracing, log aggregation, custom metrics) | 🟡 | Custom per-service + Traefik gateway metrics/dashboards; no tracing or log aggregation yet |
| Advanced AI (RAG, vector DB) | 🟡 | Spoiler-safe context filtering (progress-bounded) as a candidate extension; full RAG/vector DB deferred (Weaviate) |

## Immediate focus (agreed)

The baseline is now built end to end — GenAI Q&A, chat orchestration, CI/CD
(Rancher + Azure), Kubernetes (Helm), and observability are all in place. The
remaining active workstream is **hardening for evaluation**:

1. **Live deployment** — keep a stable tutor-accessible URL up that reflects the
   final submission (the primary hard-fail exposure).
2. **Clean boot** — resolve/confirm the local `catalog` Flyway startup failure
   (verify it is a stale-volume issue via `down -v`, not a real bug).
3. **Alert delivery** — wire Alertmanager/notification routing (rules exist;
   delivery does not).
4. **Documentation** — fix the stale `infra/k8s/README.md` "not yet included" note
   (ServiceMonitor/PrometheusRule now exist).

**✅ DONE:** GenAI Q&A (`/genai/ask` + LLM call, spoiler-safe), `chat` → `genai`
orchestration with integration/spoiler-trap tests, CI/CD to Rancher + Azure,
Kubernetes Helm chart (incl. ServiceMonitor/PrometheusRule), and observability
(Prometheus metrics, two Grafana dashboards exported as `.json`, two alert
rules). See `infra/observability/`, `infra/k8s/`, and `docs/observability.md`.

See [`docs/grading-dashboard.md`](grading-dashboard.md) for the criterion-level
status view.
