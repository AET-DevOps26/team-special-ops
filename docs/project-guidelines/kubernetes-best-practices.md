Concrete Tips and Hints

1. ✅ Microservice Architecture & Design Best Practices

Single Responsibility Services: Each microservice should encapsulate one specific domain or business capability. Avoid feature creep and overlapping responsibilities.
Stateless Services: Design services to be stateless. Store session/context in tokens (e.g., JWT) or shared databases/cache layers like Redis if necessary.
Language Boundary Awareness: Carefully define the interface (OpenAPI spec) between Spring Boot (Java) and Langchain (Python). Use JSON over HTTP, not internal data structures.
2. 📐 API-Driven Design and OpenAPI Usage

Design First

Teams should define and review the OpenAPI specs collaboratively before implementing any logic.
Use tools like Swagger Editor or Stoplight.
Use OpenAPI Code Generators

Java (Spring Boot): springdoc-openapi or OpenAPI Generator. Use Spring Boot 4.x and Java 25 (LTS)
Python: openapi-python-client
Versioning: Always version APIs (e.g., /api/v1/resource) from day one to prevent breaking clients during iteration.
API-First, Contract-Strong

Task	Concrete Tool / Command
Edit & lint spec	npx @redocly/cli lint api/openapi.yaml (Spectral rules)
Generate Java stubs	openapi-generator-cli generate -i api/openapi.yaml -g spring -o services/spring-order/generated
Generate Python client	openapi-python-client --path api/openapi.yaml --output services/py-recommender/client
Generate TypeScript SDK	npx openapi-typescript api/openapi.yaml -o web-client/src/api.ts
Mock server for client	npx prism mock api/openapi.yaml (runs on port 4010)
Never merge without running the linter; add it to a pre-commit hook.

The OpenAPI spec lives once in /api. Every language consumes it via code-gen.
No hand-written DTOs. Use records (immutable) for DTOs in Java.
👀 Minimal gen-all.sh helper (drop in /api/scripts)

#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

openapi-generator-cli generate -i api/openapi.yaml -g spring \
  -o services/spring-order/generated --skip-validate-spec

openapi-python-client --path api/openapi.yaml \
  --output services/py-recommender/client --config api/scripts/py-config.json

npx openapi-typescript api/openapi.yaml -o web-client/src/api.ts
Make it executable and callable from CI; run ./api/scripts/gen-all.sh after each spec change.

💡 Tip: Add a Git hook (post-checkout, post-merge) to run ./api/scripts/gen-all.sh automatically. This ensures generated clients are always up-to-date after switching branches or pulling changes.

3. 🔐 Security Best Practices

Use OAuth2 / OIDC via API gateway (e.g., Keycloak, GitHub, Auth0).
Pass JWTs through HTTP headers.
Each service must verify the token using a shared public key.
Gateways (like Traefik or NGINX) can centralize token validation.
👉 Tip: Place the gateway as the entrypoint to intercept and validate tokens before forwarding to services.

4. ⚙️ Development and Deployment Practices

Contract Testing: Use Pact or similar tools to ensure API contract fidelity between producer (Spring Boot) and consumer (Langchain).
Service Discovery: Use an API gateway (e.g., Traefik, NGINX) to route and secure APIs. Avoid direct service-to-service calls across languages unless encapsulated.
Consistent Error Handling: Use a unified error schema in OpenAPI: {code, message, details}. Enforce it across all services and in the OpenAPI spec.
CI/CD Pipeline: Automate OpenAPI linting, stub generation, and testing in GitHub Actions. Always validate that OpenAPI specs match implementation on each build.
Docker Image Publishing: Push container images to a registry with semantic version tags (e.g., ghcr.io/org/service:1.0.0) and/or Git commit SHA (:sha-abc123) to ensure traceability and reproducibility across environments.
GitHub Actions Pipeline Example

# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths-ignore:
      - 'README.md'
  pull_request:

concurrency: ci-${{ github.ref }}

jobs:
  generate-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        service: [spring-order, py-recommender, web-client]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Lint OpenAPI
        run: npx @redocly/cli lint api/openapi.yaml

      - name: Generate code
        run: ./api/scripts/gen-all.sh
        shell: bash

      - name: Cache Maven / npm / pip
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: |
            ~/.m2/repository
            ~/.cache/pip
            ~/.npm
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('**/lockfiles') }}

      - name: Build & test
        working-directory: services/${{ matrix.service }}
        run: |
          case ${{ matrix.service }} in
            spring-order) ./mvnw verify ;;

Local Development and Runtime

Area	Hands-on Choice	Why
Service discovery	Simple API Gateway.	Leads to one ingress, easier CORS, security.
Data isolation	One PostgreSQL database per service (logical schema ok).	Classic microservice rule → avoids coupling
Dev containers	devcontainer.json + VS Code, Docker-in-Docker enabled	Requires zero local setup.
Local orchestration	Include a file called docker-compose up in /infra	Offers DBs + gateway + both services in one command.
Cross-service call	Python → Java via generated TypeScript-style client (py-recommender/client).	Consistent via OpenAPI through reusing same OpenAPI spec, avoids hidden internal formats
Observability	Spring Boot Actuator + Prometheus; Include LangChain's tracing to OpenTelementry; Scrape via Docker Compose	Production-grade insights with minimal code.
5. 💻 Client Integration

Import generated api.ts in React or similar.
Runtime base URL comes from .env file: VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
For CORS, configure gateway:
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      globalcors:
        corsConfigurations:
          '[/**]':
            allowedOrigins: "*"
            allowedMethods: "*"
Use SWR or React Query for caching and retries.
6. 🤝 Collaboration Best Practices

Ritual	Concrete Action
API review	Weekly 15-min sync to review openapi.yaml changes
Definition of Done	PR must include: ✅ Passing CI, ✅ Updated spec, ✅ Short doc (/docs/adr-xyz.md)
Doc automation	Generate and publish OpenAPI docs with: redoc-cli bundle api/openapi.yaml -o docs/api.html → deploy with GH Pages((/docs folder)).
Issue template	Add checkboxes in the "Describe Changes" section: “Affects API?”, “Spec updated?” ; Create a PR template
7. 🧪 Write Tests

Consider implementing integration and end-to-end (E2E) tests per microservice.
These tests should include interactions with the database and any external APIs to ensure that services behave correctly as the system evolves.
This helps maintain stability and avoid regressions when introducing new features.
8. 🚫 What Not To Do

❌ No direct HTTP calls without generated client
❌ No shared DTOs/utilities outside the OpenAPI spec
❌ No long-running branches (max 2 days → rebase/merge)
❌ No manual production deploys — everything must go through CI/CD
