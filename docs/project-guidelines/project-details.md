Objective

The project requires teams to design, implement, and operate a complete software system that reflects a realistic DevOps workflow. The goal is to demonstrate how a system is structured, integrated, deployed, and maintained in a reproducible and observable way. Development, deployment, and operation must therefore be treated as a single engineering problem rather than as separate phases.

At the technical level, the project must result in a web application that includes a client side, a server side, persistent storage, and a separate Generative AI component. The system must be containerised, runnable locally, automatically tested and deployed through GitHub Actions, deployable to Kubernetes, and observable through Prometheus and Grafana. The application domain is flexible, but the technical and process requirements are fixed and must all be satisfied.

The project is intended to simulate a realistic cloud-native software delivery scenario. The final result must be structured in a way that supports modular development, reproducible setup, automated deployment, and operational visibility.

Deadline: to be announced (EOD – 23:59 Munich time)

Aspect	Requirement
Project type	Complete DevOps-oriented software system
Main focus	Development, deployment, operation, and observability as one integrated workflow
Required system elements	Client, server, database, GenAI, CI/CD, Kubernetes, monitoring
Application domain	Flexible, but all technical requirements must be fulfilled
Team Organisation

Teams consist of three students. Each student must take responsibility for one primary subsystem, typically client, server, or GenAI. However, subsystem ownership does not imply isolated work. Teams are expected to collaborate across subsystem boundaries, especially for integration, deployment, and debugging. A project where each student only works on their part without participating in system integration does not reflect the intended DevOps model.

Registration information is required in order to make contribution tracking possible and to connect repository activity to individual team members. Therefore, each student must provide their GitHub username, TUMonline login, and matriculation number.

Work must be transparent and traceable throughout the semester. This means that contributions must be visible through GitHub commits, pull request authorship, code review participation, and involvement in infrastructure tasks such as CI/CD configuration and deployment.

Communication must take place through the official course channels. Tutor feedback, planning, questions, and issue reporting must be visible in the dedicated Artemis team channels. No other communication channel will be taken into account for evaluation. Teams are expected to work in an organised and responsive way and to treat communication as part of engineering practice.

Aspect	Requirement
Team size	3 students
Registration	GitHub username, TUMonline login, matriculation number
Ownership	Each student owns a primary subsystem (client, server, GenAI)
Collaboration	Collaborative development across subsystem boundaries is expected
Contribution tracking	Visible via commits, PRs, code reviews, and infrastructure work
Communication	Only official course channels in Artemis
Development Workflow

The project must be developed in a GitHub mono-repository. Therefore, the system is must be treated as one integrated deliverable. A mono-repo makes it possible to version client, server, GenAI service, deployment files, CI/CD workflows, and documentation together, and to validate changes across the whole system.

All work must be structured through pull requests. Each feature or bugfix must be developed in a dedicated feature branch. Direct commits to the main branch are not acceptable as a normal workflow. A pull request must be opened, reviewed, and approved before the change is merged into main. Team members must peer-review each other’s work. Review is part of the workflow and should be treated as a normal step before merging changes.

The CI pipeline must run automatically on every pull request. At a minimum, it must build the relevant services and execute the automated tests. On merge to main, the CD pipeline must automatically deploy the system to a Kubernetes environment. The intended workflow is therefore: develop in a feature branch, validate through CI, review through PR, merge into main, and deploy automatically.

Aspect	Requirement
Repository	GitHub mono-repo
Branching	Each feature or bugfix developed in a feature branch
Pull Requests	Mandatory before merge into main
Code review	Peer review and approval by team members required
CI checks	Automated tests and validation on every PR
CD behaviour	Automatic deployment to Kubernetes on merge to main
System Architecture

The system must be structured as a set of interacting but separated components. At minimum, this includes a client side, a server side, a database, and a separate GenAI component. The client side must provide a usable interface and communicate with the server over REST. The server side must expose REST APIs, coordinate business logic, and interact with persistent storage. The database must support persistent data storage and must have a documented schema. The GenAI component must run as an independent service and communicate with the remaining services over a defined interface.

The server side must be implemented in Spring Boot and must consist of at least three microservices. ****These services do not need to be large, but they must have distinct responsibilities and communicate in a controlled and documented way.

The client side may be implemented in React, Angular, or Vue.js. It must provide a usable and responsive interface and interact with the server over REST APIs. The database may be MySQL, PostgreSQL, or a similar relational or persistent database system, but it must run via Docker in local development and support documented persistent storage in the deployed setup.

Component	Technology	Notes
Client Side	React, Angular, Vue.js	Usable, responsive UI that interacts with server over REST
Server Side	Spring Boot (Java)	Must expose REST APIs and consist of at least 3 microservices; modular architecture required
Database	MySQL or PostgreSQL or similar	Must support persistent storage; schema must be documented; run via Docker
GenAI Component

The GenAI component must be implemented as a separate service in Python. It must be deployed as a modular microservice, containerised independently, networked with the server, and integrated through a defined interface.

Functionally, the GenAI component must fulfil a real user-facing use case. Acceptable examples include summarisation, generation, question answering, or a similarly meaningful feature that is accessible through the application workflow. It is not sufficient to include a GenAI service that exists technically but is not connected to an actual user-facing capability.

The system must support both cloud-based and local large language models. Cloud support may be implemented through providers such as the OpenAI API. Local model support may be implemented using technologies such as GPT4All or LLaMA. Teams do not need to demonstrate sophisticated model research, but they do need to demonstrate that the service architecture can work with both remote and local inference options where feasible.

As an optional advanced bonus, teams may implement a full retrieval-augmented generation setup using a vector database such as Weaviate.

Aspect	Requirement
Language	Python
Deployment	Modular microservice, containerised and networked with the server
Functionality	Real user-facing use case, e.g. summarisation, generation, Q&A
Model support	Cloud-based models (e.g. OpenAI API) and local models (e.g. GPT4All, LLaMA)
Optional bonus	Full RAG architecture using a vector database such as Weaviate
Environment and Deployment

All components must be fully containerised and runnable locally using a compose-based setup. This includes the client, the server-side services, the GenAI service, and the database. Each component must therefore have its own Dockerfile. The local setup must support end-to-end system execution through a docker-compose.yml file.

The local setup must be simple. The system must be runnable in three or fewer commands, for example by building and starting through docker compose up. The setup must provide sane defaults, which means that students should not rely on long manual configuration instructions or complex environment preparation steps. A new user must be able to start the system without reverse-engineering the project.

The same system must also be deployable to Kubernetes. Deployment may be implemented either through Helm charts or raw Kubernetes manifests. The project must support deployment on the course infrastructure via Rancher and also on one cloud environment, which in your current version is Azure. Configuration must be externalised using environment variables, Secrets, and similar mechanisms. Hardcoded credentials, hardcoded environment-dependent values, or manual configuration in the code are not acceptable.

Aspect	Requirement
Containerisation	All components (server, client, GenAI, DB) must have their own Dockerfile
Local orchestration	docker-compose.yml must run the system end-to-end locally
Setup	Runnable in three or fewer commands; no complex manual ENV setup
Kubernetes	Deployable using Helm or raw manifests
Environments	Local infrastructure (Rancher) and a cloud option (Azure)
CI/CD

The system must include a working CI/CD pipeline implemented with GitHub Actions. The pipeline must reflect the actual lifecycle of the system and must be reliable enough that it can be treated as part of the system.

Continuous Integration must build and test all services. It must also perform static analysis or linting where appropriate. This means that the CI pipeline should validate the codebase before integration into the main branch and should fail when the system is not in a correct or stable state.

Continuous Deployment must automatically deploy to Kubernetes after merge to main. This deployment process must be reproducible and maintainable. The workflow must make correct use of secrets and environment-specific variables. Hardcoded tokens should be avoided.

Aspect	Requirement
Tooling	GitHub Actions
CI tasks	Build and test all services; perform static analysis/linting
CD tasks	Automatically deploy to Kubernetes on merge to main
Configuration	Must use secrets and support environment-specific variables
Observability

The system must expose basic but meaningful operational visibility. This means that monitoring should not stop at “Prometheus is installed” or “Grafana is running.” Instead, the monitored data must allow someone to understand whether the system is behaving correctly or incorrectly.

Prometheus must be used for metrics collection. At minimum, the project must track request count, latency, and error rate. These metrics should cover the core runtime behaviour of the system, especially on the server side and, where relevant, the GenAI component. Grafana must be used for visualisation, and dashboards must reflect key system metrics. These dashboards must be submitted as exported .json files. At least one meaningful alert rule must be configured, for example for service downtime or slow response time.

Tool	Requirements
Prometheus	Metrics collection for at least request count, latency, and error rate
Grafana	Dashboards must reflect key system metrics (server, GenAI); must be submitted as .json
Alerts	At least one meaningful alert rule, e.g. service down or slow response time
Testing

Testing must validate the behaviour of the system. Tests must cover critical server-side logic, relevant parts of the GenAI component, and important client-side workflows and interactions.

Unit tests are mandatory for critical server and GenAI logic. Client-side tests should cover core workflows and interactions. All tests must run automatically in the CI pipeline. The pipeline should therefore act as the main enforcement point for system stability and should prevent broken changes from being merged.

Aspect	Requirement
Unit Tests	Must cover critical server and GenAI logic
Client Tests	Should cover core workflows and interactions
CI Testing	All tests must run automatically in the CI pipeline
Engineering Artefacts

Teams must provide engineering artefacts that explain how the system is structured and how it works. These artefacts must reflect the actual implementation and must support understanding, reproducibility, and evaluation.

A high-level architecture description is required, together with decomposition into subsystems and their interfaces. UML-style diagrams are mandatory. Specifically, the project must include a Subsystem Decomposition diagram, a Use Case Diagram, and an Analysis Object Model. In addition, the system must provide API documentation through OpenAPI/Swagger and expose Swagger UI or an equivalent interface.

Aspect	Requirement
Architecture	High-level system description
Decomposition	Subsystems and interfaces
Architecture Diagrams	UML-style diagrams: Subsystem Decomposition, Use Case Diagram, Analysis Object Model are mandatory
API documentation	Must provide OpenAPI/Swagger documentation and expose Swagger UI or equivalent
Deliverables

The final submission must include the complete codebase for the client, server, and GenAI services, together with all configuration required to run the system locally and to deploy it to Kubernetes. This includes Dockerfiles, the compose setup, deployment manifests or Helm charts, CI/CD workflows, and monitoring configuration.

The monitoring setup must include Prometheus and Grafana configuration, exported dashboards, and alert rule files. The testing suite must be included together with instructions for how to run it. Documentation in README.md must include setup instructions, architecture information, API documentation references, CI/CD and monitoring instructions, and an explanation of student responsibilities.

The project concludes with a final presentation, as well as individual oral examination. You need to be prepared to defend thee whole project, as well as your individual contribution within it. The final team presentation must include a live demo. Each student must present and explain their subsystem and be ready to answer technical questions.

Source Code	Complete codebase for server, client, and GenAI services
Docker Setup	Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml for local setup
Kubernetes Deployment	Helm charts or raw Kubernetes YAMLs with setup instructions
Monitoring Configuration	Prometheus and Grafana config with exported dashboards and alert rules
Testing Suite	Unit/integration tests with instructions to run them
Documentation	README.md with setup guide, architecture, API docs, CI/CD and monitoring instructions, student responsibilities
Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

Creating a project in a team with other people, even if they are your friends, is not easy. Truly effective collaboration with people who have distinct views, skills, and working styles requires significant effort in order for it to work well. To help you with it, we would like to provide recommendations based on personal experience from continuous observation of different teams, as well as general good practices.

A smart man learns from his mistakes, a wise man learns from the mistakes of others.
Effective project

Reliability > Feature count

One of the very common reasons for a team to fail is feature orientation. It might seem reasonable that the best strategy is to build as many features as possible in the shortest time. But quality can never beat quantity this way. If you cannot reliably deploy or run every new feature you create, you will eventually fail with the whole flow of project execution. One of the important DevOps principles is that fast, reliable flow is more important than feature count. We recommend the following strategy: keep the scope small, make the system deployable early, and iterate on it.

The system is a single pipeline

Every part of the system is a different component, but they are all interconnected and dependent on each other. A big mistake is to think about coding, deployment, and monitoring as three separate components — the system you create with this strategy would ended up just a codebase. The best practice you can implement is to link every component of the system into one chain: code → test → build → deploy → observe → improve

Reproducibility

The joke “it works on my machine” is as old as time. This might create the impression that this problem is no longer relevant or already solved by someone. In reality, this is still one of the major problems for people who do not keep reproducibility in mind at all times. Try to ask yourself after each feature is implemented: “Can someone else run your system without you?” Typical failures include many manual steps and undocumented environments. The best advice is to make setup trivial: try to eliminate manual configuration and make sure to test the setup yourself from scratch at least a couple of times.

Visible system behaviour

Monitoring might seem like the easiest and most fun part of the responsibilities. In reality, it requires significant effort, understanding of system functionality, awareness of common pitfalls, understanding your system’s drawbacks, and an analytical mindset to create truly useful monitoring. Many teams “install monitoring”, but dashboards show nothing useful. Remember that all dashboards must be linked to system behaviour. You need to be able to monitor what can break. Visualisation of latency, failures, and load will help you and your team understand the system state, instead of collecting data without purpose.

Patterns of failure

Project as a checklist

The easiest way to think about the project is to treat it as a collection of checkpoints you need to mark. Required to have dashboards and alerts? Install Prometheus, add 1 dashboard, add 1 alert ✅ done. If you only aim to pass the requirement, the quality of the system drops drastically. Requirements should serve only as a starting point, on top of which you add your own ideas, understanding, and experience. When you think about the project only as a collection of checkpoints, you distance yourself from it and forget its purpose and logical functionality. Try to give every requirement meaning and connect it to real system behaviour.

Late integration

What fails most projects one week before submission? Late integration. To the question “If you could start the project again, what would you do differently?”, the most common answer is: “I would start integration much earlier.” Too many teams build components separately and integrate them at the very end. Every time the result is the same: CI/CD breaks, deployment becomes unstable, and eventually the system is incomplete. Try to follow this recommendation and start integration as early as possible with your team.

Fake CI/CD

It’s easy to have CI/CD, but it’s extremely hard to have good CI/CD. Very often the pipeline exists, but tests are meaningless or missing. It is easy to get frustrated if your pipeline runs too long, fails randomly, or requires manual approval for small changes. Try to make your life easier early and follow good CI/CD practices from the beginning: https://about.gitlab.com/blog/how-to-keep-up-with-ci-cd-best-practices/

GenAI as decoration

GenAI might not be everyone’s cup of tea. If you are not interested in working with this technology, it might be a frustrating experience, and you might catch yourself integrating GenAI just as a checkbox. In reality, when working on industrial projects, you often need to work with things you would not choose yourself. A very important quality of a DevOps engineer is flexibility and willingness to learn. Use this opportunity to learn a new technology and think about real challenges modern teams are solving.

“I will document it later”

Needless to say, we all fall into this trap. You spend hours debugging a feature, finally fix it, push, commit… and then: “I will document it tomorrow.” Then the next day you come back and no longer fully understand your own code. Always start a new class or method with a short comment describing its purpose. This helps structure your thinking and understand what you are doing. Try to document as you go and make it a habit. It helps not only you, but also anyone who looks at your code later, and improves maintainability.

Team culture

A good project is not built by perfect individuals working all by themselves. The best teams consist of people who communicate effectively, take responsibility, and support each other when needed.

Other people cannot read your thoughts

If something is bothering you, bring it up for discussion as soon as possible. The earlier you do it, the easier it is to resolve. Otherwise, issues accumulate over time and can lead to frustration. At the same time, do not blame others for things you never communicated as concerns. If you encounter a problem you cannot resolve within your team, contact your tutor or instructor.

Clear roles and responsibilities

It is easy to avoid responsibility if you do not clearly understand what you are responsible for. Right after forming a team, one of the first things to discuss is individual responsibilities. Try to define roles similar to those in real projects, and thought the project execution define reponsibilities and accountability for various tasks. We recommend to use a RACI matrix for this: https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/project-management/raci-chart

Individual strength Everyone in a team has different strengths and weaknesses. Some may already have industrial experience and a strong technical background, others are strong in theory, and others are better at planning and communication. Good teams are technically strong, but great teams consist of people who complement each other. We would like you to use this opportunity to work with different people, and being eager to teach what you know, and learn what you do not.
